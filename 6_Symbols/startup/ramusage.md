Here's the code with comments estimating RAM and VRAM usage:

```powershell
# Launch WhatsApp
Start-Process "whatsapp:"
# Estimated RAM: 150-200 MB, VRAM: Minimal (5-10 MB)

# Define the path to Chrome executable
$chromePath = "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"

# URLs to open in Chrome instances
$urls = @(
    "https://chatgpt.com/?hints=search&ref=ext&model=auto",
    "https://claude.ai/new",
    "https://to-do.office.com/tasks/",
    "https://www.perplexity.ai/",
    "https://www.linkedin.com/"
    "https://www.gmail.com/"
    "https://vdo.ninja/?director=rifaterdemsahin"
)

# Launch each URL in a new Chrome window
foreach ($url in $urls) {
    Start-Process $chromePath -ArgumentList "--new-window", $url
}
# Estimated RAM: 200-300 MB per tab, total ~1.4-2.1 GB
# Estimated VRAM: 50-100 MB per tab, total ~350-700 MB

# Launch OBS Studio with administrative privileges
$obsPath = "C:\Program Files\obs-studio\bin\64bit\obs64.exe"
$obsWorkingDirectory = "C:\Program Files\obs-studio\bin\64bit"
Start-Process -FilePath $obsPath -WorkingDirectory $obsWorkingDirectory -Verb RunAs
# Estimated RAM: 500-800 MB
# Estimated VRAM: 500-1000 MB (depends on scenes and sources)

# Launch LM Studio with administrative privileges
$lmStudioPath = "C:\Users\Pexabo\AppData\Local\Programs\LM Studio\LM Studio.exe"
Start-Process -FilePath $lmStudioPath -Verb RunAs
# Estimated RAM: 500-1000 MB (depends on model size)
# Estimated VRAM: Varies greatly, from 2-8 GB or more depending on model size
```

Total estimated usage:
RAM: 2.55-4.1 GB
VRAM: 2.9-9.7 GB

Note that these estimates are approximate and can vary significantly based on system configuration, content loaded, and specific usage patterns[2][4][7]. The actual usage may be higher or lower depending on various factors such as the complexity of OBS scenes, the size of the language model loaded in LM Studio, and the content of the web pages opened in Chrome[3][10].
