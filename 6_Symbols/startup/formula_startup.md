To create a PowerShell startup script that launches WhatsApp, four instances of Google Chrome, and OBS Studio, follow these steps:

1. **Determine Application Paths**:
   - **WhatsApp**: If installed from the Microsoft Store, use the URI scheme `whatsapp:` to launch it.
   - **Google Chrome**: Typically located at `C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe`.
   - **OBS Studio**: Usually found at `C:\Program Files\obs-studio\bin\64bit\obs64.exe`.

2. **Create the PowerShell Script**:
   - Open a text editor and input the following script:

     ```powershell
     # Launch WhatsApp
     Start-Process "whatsapp:"

     # Define the path to Chrome executable
     $chromePath = "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"

     # URLs to open in Chrome instances
     $urls = @(
         "https://www.example1.com",
         "https://www.example2.com",
         "https://www.example3.com",
         "https://www.example4.com"
     )

     # Launch each URL in a new Chrome window
     foreach ($url in $urls) {
         Start-Process $chromePath -ArgumentList "--new-window", $url
     }

     # Launch OBS Studio
     $obsPath = "C:\Program Files\obs-studio\bin\64bit\obs64.exe"
     Start-Process $obsPath
     ```

   - Replace the URLs in the `$urls` array with the desired websites you want to open in each Chrome instance.

3. **Save the Script**:
   - Save the file with a `.ps1` extension, for example, `StartupScript.ps1`.

4. **Set Execution Policy**:
   - Ensure that your system allows the execution of PowerShell scripts.
   - Open PowerShell as an administrator and run:

     ```powershell
     Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
     ```

     This command permits the execution of locally created scripts.

5. **Automate Script Execution on Startup**:
   - Place a shortcut to the `StartupScript.ps1` in the Windows Startup folder:
     - Press `Win + R`, type `shell:startup`, and press Enter.
     - In the Startup folder, right-click and select `New` > `Shortcut`.
     - For the shortcut's location, enter:

       ```powershell
       powershell.exe -File "C:\Path\To\Your\StartupScript.ps1"
       ```

       Replace `"C:\Path\To\Your\StartupScript.ps1"` with the actual path to your script.

     - Click `Next`, name the shortcut as desired, and click `Finish`.

**Notes**:

- **WhatsApp Launch**: Launching WhatsApp using the URI scheme `whatsapp:` is effective if it's installed from the Microsoft Store. If you encounter issues, ensure that WhatsApp is installed correctly and that the URI scheme is registered.

- **Chrome Instances**: The script launches each URL in a new Chrome window. If you prefer to open them in tabs within a single window, modify the `Start-Process` line to:

  ```powershell
  Start-Process $chromePath -ArgumentList $urls
  ```

  This approach opens all specified URLs in separate tabs of a single Chrome window.

- **OBS Studio**: The script starts OBS Studio with default settings. If you need to specify a particular profile or scene collection, consider using the `obs-powershell` module, which allows for more advanced configurations. citeturn0search0

By following these steps, your PowerShell script will launch WhatsApp, four Chrome instances (each with a specified URL), and OBS Studio upon startup.
