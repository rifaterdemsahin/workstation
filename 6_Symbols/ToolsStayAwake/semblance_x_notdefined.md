It looks like there are a couple of issues in the code:

1. **`x` and `y` are not defined**: The error occurs because `x` and `y` are not initialized before they are used. You're using `target_x` and `target_y`, but you never set `x` and `y` in the main loop.
   
2. **Mouse position tracking**: You're using `time.time()` as the mouse position, which is incorrect. You need to actually get the current mouse position.

3. **`update_positions()` function**: The function `get_position()` is expecting `mouse_x` and `mouse_y` as arguments, but you're not providing them correctly.

Here's an updated version of the code with corrections:

```python
import random
import time
import pyautogui  # You'll need to install pyautogui (pip install pyautogui)

# Define a list of target positions. These are your predefined points on the screen where you can click or press keys.
targets = [
    (0, 0),          # top-left corner
    (640, 480),       # center of window
    (1024, 0),       # bottom-right corner
    (1024, 480)        # opposite to center
]

def get_position(mouse_x, mouse_y, target):
    """Calculate the position relative to the target."""
    dx = mouse_x - target[0]
    dy = mouse_y - target[1]
    return [dx, dy]

def update_positions(mouse_x, mouse_y):
    global targets

    # Calculate the absolute positions of each target
    for i in range(len(targets)):
        x, y = targets[i]
        relative = get_position(mouse_x, mouse_y, targets[i])
        targets[i] = (x + relative[0], y + relative[1])

# Main program loop
keymap = {
    'ArrowLeft': (-15, 0),
    'ArrowUp': (0, -15),
    'ArrowRight': (15, 0),
    'ArrowDown': (0, 15)
}

while True:
    # Get current absolute mouse position
    mouse_x, mouse_y = pyautogui.position()  # This will return current mouse position
    
    # Update positions based on keyboard input
    for key, (dx, dy) in keymap.items():
        target_x = mouse_x + dx
        target_y = mouse_y + dy

        update_positions(mouse_x, mouse_y)
        
    # Print the relative positions of each target
    for i in range(len(targets)):
        print("Absolute Position:", targets[i])
        print(f"Relative Press: {targets[i][0]} + {targets[i][1]} Press", end="\n")
    
    time.sleep(0.1)  # Slow down the loop for better performance
```

### Key Changes:
- **`pyautogui`**: This module is used to get the mouse position. Install it via `pip install pyautogui`.
- **`update_positions()`**: This now properly updates the positions with the correct mouse coordinates.
- **`target_x`, `target_y`**: These are now initialized with `mouse_x + dx` and `mouse_y + dy`.

Make sure you install `pyautogui` and test it again!
